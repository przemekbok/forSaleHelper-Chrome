## About

This is a simple addon for the [BGA](https://boardgamearena.com) platform's 'For
Sale' board game. It counts all harvested cards and current player balance.
I hope it could work good on your chrome instance because in my case I struggled a lot with implementing a content scripts (for on many layers, like url filter and script implementation).

## If you think you can improve it, please commit to this repository!
